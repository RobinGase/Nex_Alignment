# Orchestrator Model Specification Template

## Status

Draft — adapt per project

## Purpose

Define **which AI models handle which task tiers** in a modular,
project-agnostic format.  Any NAP-governed project can import this spec,
override the model table, and inherit the routing logic, escalation rules,
and governance hooks unchanged.

This template is designed so a fresh agent session can pick it up and
continue work without prior conversation context.

## 1  Model Roster

> **Customize this table for your project.**

| Slot | Model | Vendor | Primary Role |
|------|-------|--------|--------------|
| **M-FAST** | _e.g. Gemini 2.5 Flash_ | _Google_ | High-volume, low-cost work: tests, mocks, readings, assessments, logging, heartbeat checks, syntax audits, primitive path audits, wiring |
| **M-HEAVY** | _e.g. Codex 5.3_ | _OpenAI_ | High-complexity tasks: multi-file refactors, deep architecture reasoning, novel algorithm design, security-critical code generation |
| **M-FRONT** | _e.g. Gemini 3.1 Pro_ | _Google_ | Front-end work: UI components, styling, layout, accessibility, client-side interaction logic |
| **M-ORCH** | _e.g. Claude opus-class_ | _Anthropic_ | **Orchestrator**: report consolidation, authenticity verification, governance routing, final decision authority |
| **M-VERIFY** | _e.g. NVIDIA API models_ | _NVIDIA_ | Independent investigation and cross-vendor verification for high-assurance decisions |

### Slot semantics

- **M-FAST** is the default. Every task starts here unless a routing rule
  explicitly assigns it elsewhere.
- **M-HEAVY** is invoked only when M-FAST confidence is below threshold or
  the task matches a complexity trigger (see Section 3).
- **M-FRONT** handles any task tagged `frontend`, `ui`, `css`, `a11y`, or
  `client-side`.
- **M-ORCH** never executes leaf tasks. It consolidates outputs from all
  other slots, performs authenticity checks, and applies NAP governance
  decisions.
- **M-VERIFY** provides independent second-opinion verification. Used in
  Tier C dual-vendor consensus (see Section 4).

## 2  Task Classification Tags

Every task entering the orchestrator must carry at least one tag.
Tags determine the initial model slot.

> **Customize this table for your domain.**

### Tag -> Slot mapping

| Tag | Default Slot | Notes |
|-----|-------------|-------|
| `test` | M-FAST | Unit tests, integration test scaffolds |
| `mock` | M-FAST | Mock data, stub services |
| `reading` | M-FAST | File reads, doc parsing, summarization |
| `assessment` | M-FAST | Feasibility checks, risk scoring |
| `logging` | M-FAST | Log format design, telemetry wiring |
| `heartbeat` | M-FAST | Health checks, liveness probes |
| `syntax-audit` | M-FAST | Lint, format, parse validation |
| `path-audit` | M-FAST | File path / import resolution checks |
| `wiring` | M-FAST | Glue code, config plumbing, adapter stubs |
| `frontend` | M-FRONT | UI components, styles, layouts |
| `ui` | M-FRONT | Same as frontend |
| `css` | M-FRONT | Stylesheet work |
| `a11y` | M-FRONT | Accessibility audit and fixes |
| `client-side` | M-FRONT | Browser/device client logic |
| `refactor` | M-HEAVY | Multi-file structural changes |
| `architecture` | M-HEAVY | System design, ADR drafting |
| `security` | M-HEAVY | Crypto, auth, vulnerability analysis |
| `novel-algorithm` | M-HEAVY | New algorithmic design |
| `consolidation` | M-ORCH | Report merging, cross-source synthesis |
| `verification` | M-VERIFY | Independent cross-vendor fact-check |

Tags not in this table default to **M-FAST**.

## 3  Escalation Rules

Escalation moves a task from its current slot to a higher-capability slot.
Escalation is **one-way up**; a task never de-escalates mid-execution.

### 3.1  Confidence-based escalation

If M-FAST returns a result with self-reported confidence below
**CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD** (default: 0.7), the orchestrator re-dispatches to
M-HEAVY.

### 3.2  Complexity triggers

The orchestrator escalates to M-HEAVY when any of these conditions are true:

- Task touches **>= 4 files** simultaneously.
- Task requires reasoning across **>= 3 architectural layers**.
- Task is tagged `security` and risk class >= 3.
- M-FAST output fails a syntax/correctness check on first attempt.

### 3.3  Dual-vendor escalation (Tier C)

For NAP Class 3+ tasks where the consequence of error is high:

1. M-HEAVY produces the primary output.
2. M-VERIFY independently produces a second output (no access to M-HEAVY's
   result).
3. M-ORCH compares both outputs and applies the **highest-safety-wins**
   conflict resolution rule.
4. If outputs conflict on a safety-relevant dimension, M-ORCH flags the
   task for **human review** (respect your project's autonomy ceiling).

### 3.4  Front-end escalation

If M-FRONT encounters logic that requires back-end integration reasoning,
it flags the task. M-ORCH splits the task:

- Front-end rendering -> stays with M-FRONT.
- Integration logic -> dispatched to M-FAST or M-HEAVY per normal rules.

## 4  Tier Summary (ADR-0003 alignment)

| Tier | Description | Models Used | NAP Gate |
|------|------------|-------------|----------|
| **A** (cheap/fast) | Default planning, drafting, bulk work | M-FAST | Standard compliance scoring |
| **B** (balanced) | Escalated when confidence or quality insufficient | M-HEAVY, M-FRONT | Manual review band if Class >= 3 |
| **C** (high assurance) | Dual-vendor consensus for critical decisions | M-HEAVY + M-VERIFY, arbitrated by M-ORCH | Block/Escalate thresholds from unified governance decision model |

---

## 5  Orchestrator Responsibilities (M-ORCH)

The orchestrator is the **only** model that:

1. **Routes tasks** to the correct slot based on tags and escalation rules.
2. **Consolidates reports** from sub-agents.
3. **Verifies authenticity** of cited sources.
4. **Applies NAP governance** — computes or delegates governance scoring per
   the unified governance decision model
   (`runtime/unified_governance_decision_model.md`).
5. **Enforces the autonomy ceiling** — no model may take autonomous action
   beyond the project's ceiling without human approval.
6. **Produces the session handoff document** when context must transfer to
   a new agent session.

The orchestrator **does not**:

- Execute leaf implementation tasks.
- Self-approve Class 3+ decisions without human review.
- Override a M-VERIFY safety objection without escalation.

## 6  Cost Control

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| Fast-model-first | M-FAST handles >= 80% of tasks by volume |
| Escalation-only heavy models | M-HEAVY invoked only on trigger, never as default |
| Batch research sweeps | M-FAST sub-agents handle large-scale parallel research; results consolidated by M-ORCH |
| Token budget per task | Orchestrator tracks cumulative token spend; warns at 80% of session budget |
| No redundant verification | Tier C dual-vendor is used only for Class 3+ safety-critical decisions, not routine work |

## 7  NAP Integration Hooks

> **Customize this section for your project's NAP profile.**

- **Profile composition**: _(declare your profiles)_
- **Effective risk floor**: _(e.g. Class 3)_
- **Autonomy ceiling**: _(e.g. A2)_
- **Conflict resolution**: highest-safety-wins
- **Required bundles**: _(list your bundles)_

### Bundle touchpoints

| Bundle | How this spec satisfies it |
|--------|--------------------------|
| B01 (Core governance) | Tier classification and escalation rules enforce risk-proportionate model selection |
| B02 (Change/data integrity) | Dual-vendor verification (Tier C) provides independent validation before critical changes |
| B06 (Runtime containment) | Orchestrator enforces slot boundaries; no model can self-escalate |
| B07 (Model supply chain) | Model roster is an explicit allowlist; no unlisted model may be invoked |

---

## 8  Continuity Protocol

When a session ends or context transfers to a new agent:

1. M-ORCH writes a **session summary** covering: completed tasks, pending
   tasks, open decisions, current risk register state.
2. The summary references this spec by path so the new agent knows the
   routing rules.
3. The new agent **must** re-read this spec before executing any routed
   task.

This ensures no routing knowledge is lost across agent handoffs.

## 9  Modularity: Using This Template

1. Copy this file into your project's architecture or governance directory.
2. Update Section 1 (Model Roster) with your actual models and vendors.
3. Update Section 2 (Tag -> Slot mapping) for your domain.
4. Update Section 7 (NAP Integration Hooks) with your project's NAP
   profile composition, or remove if not using NAP.
5. Leave Sections 3-6 and 8 unchanged unless your escalation or cost
   policies differ.

The spec is intentionally **vendor-neutral in structure** — the slot names
(M-FAST, M-HEAVY, M-FRONT, M-ORCH, M-VERIFY) are abstract; only the
roster table binds them to concrete models.
